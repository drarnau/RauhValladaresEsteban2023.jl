"""
    latexcf(gaps::Dict{String, AggregateData})

Generates a LaTeX table with counterfactual results based on the provided `gaps` dictionary.

# Arguments
- `gaps::Dict{String, AggregateData}`: Dictionary containing counterfactual results for different scenarios. The keys are scenario names, and the values are `AggregateData` instances representing the gaps.

# Note
- This function generates a LaTeX document and saves it as a file named "counterfactuals.tex" in the "tables" directory. The LaTeX document contains a table displaying the counterfactual results.
